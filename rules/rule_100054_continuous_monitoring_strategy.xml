Notes:

CJIS 5.4.3 | NIST CA-7: Continuous Monitoring

* Assumptions:
-- The system generates logs or telemetry for the presence/absence of monitoring metrics and reporting events.
-- monitoring.status may reflect boolean state; metric.reporting.status may indicate missing reports or delayed evaluations.

* Integration Options:
-- Wazuh integration with a configuration compliance tool (like OpenSCAP, Wazuh SCA) can validate strategy presence.
-- Scheduled job audit logs (cron, task scheduler) could confirm reporting frequency or identify gaps.

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
Absence of continuous monitoring or failure to assess/report system status breaks visibility across the security lifecycle.
