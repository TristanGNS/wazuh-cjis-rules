Notes:

CJIS 5.5.6 | NIST SI-4 – System Monitoring

This rule enforces visibility and accountability for all activity across remote access vectors, and ensures ongoing situational awareness of emerging threats.

Suggested Log Sources:
- IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)
- EDR/XDR solutions
- VPN logs (e.g., OpenVPN, Cisco AnyConnect)
- Firewall traffic patterns
- Behavioral monitoring (UEBA, Wazuh, OSSEC)

Response Examples:
- Alerting on brute force attempts over VPN
- Flagging anomalies in command behavior during RDP sessions
- Logging access to CJIS systems outside business hours

Failure to implement SI-4 results in:
- No visibility into attack attempts
- Delayed incident response
- Non-compliance with real-time monitoring mandates

Risks if Unmet:
- Lack of real-time insight into system misuse
- Delayed containment of threats
- Inability to correlate attack patterns
