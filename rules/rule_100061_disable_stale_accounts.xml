Notes:

CJIS 5.5.1 | NIST AC-2(3): Disable Accounts

* Requirements:
  - Disable user accounts under any of the following circumstances:
    a. Expired accounts (e.g., contract end, temporary credentials)
    b. Disassociated accounts (e.g., user has left organization)
    c. Policy violations (e.g., detected misuse)
    d. Inactivity exceeding defined thresholds (e.g., 30 days, 90 days)

* Assumptions:
  - Inactivity tracking is enforced via:
    • Authentication logs (Linux `/var/log/wtmp`, Windows 4624/4634)
    • Last logon timestamps from LDAP, AD, or system tools
    • Scripts or Wazuh active response modules used for disabling inactive accounts
  - Disablement is logged and visible to Wazuh through:
    • `usermod --expiredate`, `passwd -l`, AD disable events, etc.

* Integration Recommendations:
  - Use scheduled Wazuh `active-response` to parse inactivity reports and disable stale accounts
  - Monitor for AD Event IDs:
    • 4725 - User account disabled
    • 4726 - User account deleted
    • 4740 - Account locked out
  - Linux: Track `passwd`, `chage`, or system scripts that enforce aging policies

* Risks if Not Monitored:
  - Stale accounts are high-risk entry points for lateral movement and privilege escalation
  - Orphaned credentials may allow terminated users continued access
  - Violates CJIS, NIST, and industry-standard IAM hygiene practices

* Tuning Suggestions:
  - Correlate this rule with login timestamps or cron job results
  - Track the effectiveness of automated disabling workflows through dashboards
