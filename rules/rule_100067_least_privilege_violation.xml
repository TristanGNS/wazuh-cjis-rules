Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2 | NIST AC-6 â€“ Least Privilege

* Purpose:
  - Limits exposure of sensitive systems and data to only those with a need to know.
  - Reduces the blast radius of compromised or misused accounts.
  - Enforces principle of minimum required access for job functions.

* Implementation should include:
  - Role-based access controls (RBAC) for all systems and cloud workloads.
  - Just-in-time (JIT) elevation or temporary administrative access via approval workflows.
  - Periodic role audits and access reviews.
  - Least privilege scanning tools (e.g., Azure AD PIM, GPO audits, AWS IAM Access Analyzer).

* Detection Use Cases:
  - Unapproved elevation (e.g., `sudo` without justification)
  - Admin role assignments outside standard workflows
  - Lateral movement tied to elevated access (e.g., PowerShell remoting to domain controllers)
  - RunAs activity by standard users
  - Windows Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)

* Assumptions:
  - Audit logs include access control violations and elevation attempts
  - Identity events (from AD, Okta, Azure, etc.) are normalized and ingested into Wazuh/SIEM

* Risks if Unmet:
  - Uncontrolled privileged access
  - Insider misuse or escalation attacks
  - Untraceable changes in critical systems
