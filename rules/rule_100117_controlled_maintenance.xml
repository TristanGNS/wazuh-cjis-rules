Notes:

CJIS 5.7.2 | NIST MA-2

This rule helps enforce secure, documented maintenance practices to ensure compliance and protect sensitive data.

Assumptions:
- Alerts are received from SIEM tools, CMDBs, or endpoint agents indicating unscheduled maintenance or missing logs.
- Data sanitization status is either logged directly or inferred from file system wiping activity.
- Manual approval systems (e.g., service desk software) feed audit logs into Wazuh via API or agent integrations.

Risks if not enforced:
- Untracked offsite repairs could lead to data breaches or compliance failure.
- Incomplete maintenance could introduce vulnerabilities or damage operational controls.
- Audit trail loss or integrity gaps during security reviews or forensic analysis.
