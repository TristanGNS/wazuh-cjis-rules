Notes:

CJIS 5.6.1 | NIST IA-2(5)

This control mandates that when group or shared accounts are used, each user must still be authenticated individually.

Examples:
- A Windows server with a shared "dispatchadmin" account should not be logged into directly. Instead, use individual user accounts and privilege escalation.
- Kiosk or dispatcher terminals must still enforce user-level login even if multiple employees use the same device.

Risk: Without individual authentication, there is no forensic trail linking actions to people.

Recommended:
- Enforce per-user authentication before any shared access
- Maintain individual audit logs
- Restrict group account usage where possible
