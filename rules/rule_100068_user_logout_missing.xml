Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2 | NIST AC-12(1) – Session Termination | User-Initiated Logouts

* Purpose:
  - Enables users to end their sessions securely and reliably.
  - Prevents residual access if a session is left open or browser/device is shared.
  - Supports zero-trust posture by enabling explicit logout as a risk mitigation control.

* Implementation Considerations:
  - A clear, visible "Log Out" or "Sign Out" option on all authenticated web and mobile applications.
  - API sessions should also expose a session revocation endpoint.
  - Endpoint logout events (e.g., Windows/Unix `logoff`, browser `localStorage.clear()` triggers) should be auditable.
  - Public terminals and shared-use kiosks must prioritize user-driven session termination.
  - Integration with federated identity platforms (Okta, Azure AD, ADFS) should cascade logouts through SSO where supported.

* Detection Use Cases:
  - Web applications with broken or hidden logout buttons
  - Authentication systems that maintain active tokens after manual logout attempts
  - Applications where `session.destroy()` or `logout()` fails to propagate to downstream systems
  - User-reported failure to log out or unexplained persistent sessions

* Assumptions:
  - Web and app logs include front-end or API responses related to logout actions
  - Session audit data is centralized into the SIEM

* Risk if Unaddressed:
  - Session hijacking or reuse
  - Persistent tokens or cookies enabling re-authentication
  - Violations of zero-trust access principles
