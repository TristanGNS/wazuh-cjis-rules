Notes:

CJIS 5.5.1 | NIST AC-2(1): Account Management â€“ Automated System Account Management

* Required Capabilities:
  - Automate lifecycle of system accounts (creation, modification, disabling, and removal)
  - Use organizationally-defined mechanisms (e.g., LDAP sync, SCIM, IAM platforms)
  - Ensure automated processes align with security policy (least privilege, revocation, etc.)
  - Integrate automation with HR systems or approval workflows when possible

* Assumptions:
  - System account provisioning and deprovisioning are performed via centralized automation
    tools like Okta, Azure AD, FreeIPA, or custom IAM workflows
  - Logs from these platforms are captured and parsed by Wazuh (or forwarded from SIEM)
  - SCIM or API-based integrations are in place with source-of-truth identity systems

* Implementation Guidance:
  - Monitor provisioning events from IAM platforms
  - Flag manual account creation/deletion events for audit (exceptions)
  - Track API-based or CLI-based account automation events
  - Detect IAM sync failures that might leave accounts unmanaged

* Risks if Unmonitored:
  - Manual provisioning bypasses security policy or logging
  - Orphaned accounts due to automation/sync failure
  - Increased time to disable terminated users' accounts
