Notes:

CJIS 5.5.1 | NIST PS-4: Personnel Termination

* Required Safeguards:
  a. Terminated employees' access must be revoked within a strict time frame (typically < 24 hours).
  b. Credentials must be invalidated, including:
     - LDAP/Active Directory credentials
     - VPN tokens or smart cards
     - MFA devices
     - Email accounts
  c. Exit interviews should include sign-off on confidentiality and data ownership
  d. Devices and physical access tools (badges, USBs, keys) must be collected
  e. Retain and monitor any organizational data/resources that were assigned to the terminated user

* Assumptions:
  - HR systems log "termination" or "separation" actions
  - Identity platforms (Azure AD, Okta, etc.) provide event logs for "disable user", "revoke token", or "delete account"
  - SIEM or log management includes offboarding workflow tracking

* Implementation:
  - Integrate HR systems with IAM platforms to automate revocation
  - Include device management (MDM) and badge/physical security revocation processes in workflow
  - Ensure logs are centralized and trigger alerts if access is not revoked within defined timeframe

* Risks if Unmet:
  - Terminated user retains system access
  - Intellectual property or sensitive data exfiltration post-employment
  - Regulatory violations due to unmanaged offboarding
