Notes:

CJIS 5.3.3 | NIST IR-2: Incident Response Training

* Assumptions:
-- Your training management system logs audits of required training completion status per user/role
-- Logs include topic or training type (e.g., `incident_response`) and status (e.g., `training.status=complete|overdue`)
-- Users are mapped to response roles at provisioning or onboarding and tracked via HR or identity system

* Integration Options:
-- HR systems with role-based training audits
-- LMS (Learning Management System) logs exported to SIEM or compliance platform
-- Custom scripts that validate against required frequency thresholds

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If training logs are not available, incomplete, or not tagged by topic/role, this rule cannot evaluate compliance. Recommend exporting or forwarding training audit logs into Wazuh or related SIEM tooling.
