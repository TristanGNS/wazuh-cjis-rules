Notes:

CJIS 5.5.5 | NIST AC-11 – Device Lock (Session Lock)

Purpose:
- Ensures workstations and mobile devices are not left exposed when unattended.
- Enforces a lockout either automatically after inactivity or manually by user policy.

Assumptions:
- Endpoint protection or audit logs capture session activity (idle time, lock event, unlock with re-auth).
- Devices support native or MDM-enforced auto-lock policies.

Examples:
- Windows Event Log showing a session locked due to inactivity after 10 minutes.
- Audit log entry recording a manual lock event initiated via user policy compliance tools.
- Unlock logs that validate successful re-authentication before access was restored.

Risks if Unchecked:
- Unauthorized individuals may access open sessions left unattended.
- Confidential information or CJIS data may be viewed, altered, or exfiltrated.
- Violations of agency mobile device or desktop workstation security policy.
