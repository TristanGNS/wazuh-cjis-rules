Notes:

CJIS 5.8.3 | NIST MA-2

This rule enforces documentation, oversight, and secure handling for maintenance and disposal of all system components and media.
- Media must be sanitized prior to off-site maintenance, repair, or disposal using approved methods (e.g., NIST SP 800-88 guidelines for data destruction).
- Explicit approval is required for the removal of equipment/media from secure areas, and must be logged.
- Maintenance records must include sanitization logs, approval documentation, chain-of-custody, and verification that controls are still effective post-maintenance.

Log sources may include:
- Maintenance/repair ticketing systems
- SIEM alerts for drive wipes, disk erasure, degaussing, crypto erasure events
- Physical access logs for equipment/media leaving facilities
- Incident tracking for failed or improper sanitization

Assumptions:
- All sanitization is performed and logged before any device leaves the secure area.
- Removal of equipment/media is always approved and traceable.
- Maintenance personnel are trained and access-controlled.
- All post-maintenance validation steps are recorded.

Risks if non-compliant:
- Data exposure from unsanitized devices sent for repair or disposal.
- Inability to demonstrate compliance during audits.
- Breach of confidentiality for sensitive CJIS-controlled data.
