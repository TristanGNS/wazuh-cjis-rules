Notes:

CJIS 5.9.1 | NIST PE-3

This rule ensures physical access to CJIS facilities is tightly controlled and auditable:
- All entry and exit points must be protected by technical or procedural controls (badges, guards, access logs).
- Access is only granted after verifying individual authorization.
- Physical access logs are maintained and regularly reviewed for anomalies.
- Special controls must be in place for public areas and visitors—such as escorts and activity monitoring.
- All access devices (keys, cards, codes) must be secured, inventoried, and promptly changed when necessary (lost, compromised, personnel change).
- Incidents such as unauthorized entry, missing audit logs, visitor policy breaches, or device/key compromise are logged for alerting and investigation.

Log sources may include:
- Electronic access control logs (badge systems, door controllers, biometrics)
- Visitor sign-in/escort logs
- Security guard logs and incident reports
- Key/combination inventory management tools

Assumptions:
- Physical access audit logs are available and can be ingested by Wazuh.
- Inventory and change events are recorded digitally or logged through security event management systems.
- Visitor management is auditable.

Risks if non-compliant:
- Physical breach or loss of CJIS data due to weak access controls or missing logs.
- Undetected visitor activity or tailgating.
- Regulatory violations and audit findings.
