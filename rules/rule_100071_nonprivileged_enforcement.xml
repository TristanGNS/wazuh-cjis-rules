Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2 | NIST AC-6(2) – Least Privilege | Non-Privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions

* Purpose:
  - Prevent privilege abuse or lateral movement by isolating high-privilege accounts to only security-relevant operations.

* Example Violations Detected:
  - Use of 'root' or 'Administrator' account to check email or browse websites
  - Domain Admin logged in to workstations outside of domain controller or management node
  - Service accounts running manual user-mode applications

* Log Source Examples:
  - Sysmon (Event ID 1) for process creation
  - Windows Security Log (Event ID 4624/4672) with logon type and user context
  - Linux audit logs showing browser/mail activity by root

* Enforcement Recommendations:
  - Require multi-account model (e.g., user@org.local + admin-user@org.local)
  - Separate local admin elevation via UAC (Windows) or `sudo` (Linux) with strict audit trail
  - Monitor for shell, browser, and GUI process execution under elevated sessions

* Assumptions:
  - Logs capture user context and process metadata
  - Role/account separation policy is published and enforced
  - Alerts help identify shadow IT or poor admin practices

* Risks if Unaddressed:
  - Compromised privileged session can access wide scope of systems
  - Blurs audit trail between operational and administrative tasks
  - Increases attack surface for phishing, malware, or insider abuse
