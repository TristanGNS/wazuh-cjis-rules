Notes:

CJIS 5.5.4 | NIST AC-8 – System Use Notification

Purpose:
- Detects absence or misconfiguration of login banners that fulfill CJIS/NIST requirements.
- Assures users receive proper legal disclosure of monitoring and consent prior to system access.

Assumptions:
- Banners are configured through PAM stack, SSHD, web login portals, or GUI desktop systems.
- Logs contain either confirmation that banners were shown or warnings/errors that indicate banner failure or bypass.
- Publicly accessible systems include appropriate disclaimers, with additional metadata in webserver logs or access scripts.

Detection Examples:
- Log shows missing banner or skipped message (e.g., “No banner present” or “Banner file not found”).
- Session logs confirm user did not acknowledge terms before accessing the system.
- Web portal logs do not include pre-access terms enforcement.

Risk if Uncontrolled:
- Legal liability due to failure to disclose monitoring practices.
- Increased chance of unauthorized access without user accountability.
- Non-compliance with CJIS, NIST, or federal executive orders governing system disclosure.
