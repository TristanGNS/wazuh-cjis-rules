Notes:

CJIS 5.6.3 | NIST IA-5(8)

Supports implementation of organizational controls to manage risks from users having multiple system accounts.

Assumptions:
- Users may be assigned different accounts on different systems (e.g., for testing, elevated access, or cross-departmental work)
- Organization must define what controls apply: e.g., IAM enforcement, periodic review, SSO deployment, or privilege separation
- Alerts may focus on overlapping login events, user ID mismatches, or multi-account behavior anomalies

Risks if unimplemented:
- Credential reuse vulnerabilities
- Policy circumvention
- Insider threat using multiple credentials to evade detection
