Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2.2 | NIST MA-4

This rule focuses on detection of unapproved or non-compliant nonlocal maintenance sessions. 

Assumptions:
- Organization has remote session logging enabled (e.g., VPN, SSH, RDP logs)
- Support staff are required to submit tickets/change orders prior to remote access
- Strong authentication is enforced on all remote access portals
- Session termination logs are available and auditable

Key risks if misconfigured:
- Shadow IT access (e.g., tools bypassing audit)
- Admin access from unknown IPs
- Retained session credentials after disconnect
