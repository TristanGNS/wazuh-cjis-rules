Notes:

CJIS 5.3.2.1 | NIST IR-4(2): Dynamic Reconfiguration

* Assumptions:
-- Organization has response playbooks that include dynamic changes like blocking IPs, modifying routes, firewall rules, DNS changes, or disabling services
-- Logs include fields that reflect reconfiguration status per component/system, e.g., `reconfiguration.status=performed|not_performed`

* Integration Options:
-- SOAR tools or firewall controllers logging live ACL/route/config push failures
-- Incident response ticketing platforms that include reconfiguration execution logs
-- Custom scripts run as part of IR automation logging to syslog or JSON pipelines

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If system changes made during incident response are not logged or validated, this rule cannot detect failures. Recommend tagging and logging reconfiguration steps tied to incident handling automation.
