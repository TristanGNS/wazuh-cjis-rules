Notes:

CJIS 5.3.2 | NIST IR-1: Incident Response Policy and Procedures

* Assumptions:
-- You maintain audit or compliance logs that include the status of incident response policies and procedures
-- These logs contain fields like `policy.name` and `policy.status`
-- Reviews are tracked on an event-based or scheduled basis (e.g., post-incident, annually)

* Integration Options:
-- Compliance or GRC platform exports (e.g., ServiceNow, LogicGate, ZenGRC)
-- Manual audit logs ingested into Wazuh via JSON, syslog, or scheduled scan
-- File hash/version monitoring on documented policy files

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If policy/procedure review cycles are not logged or monitored, this rule cannot be used effectively. Recommend establishing audit tracking for document review or version control systems.
