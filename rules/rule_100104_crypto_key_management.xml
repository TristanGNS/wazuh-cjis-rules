Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2.2 | NIST SC-12

This rule detects potential mismanagement of cryptographic keys, including unauthorized access, invalid formats, insecure storage methods, and operational failures related to generation/distribution.

Assumptions:
- Cryptographic event logs are parsed from system crypto libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, GnuTLS), HSM logs, and secure key stores.
- Key lifecycle events (creation, revocation, destruction) are captured via audit trail or syslog.
- Systems enforce key validation checks during authentication or secure transactions.

If this rule triggers:
- It may indicate noncompliance with CJIS Section 5.6.2.2 or SC-12 cryptographic handling standards.
