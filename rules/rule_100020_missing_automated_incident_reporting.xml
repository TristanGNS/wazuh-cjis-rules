<!--
Notes:
* Assumptions:
-- Your environment has automated incident response tooling (e.g., ticketing systems, SIEM alerts, SOAR, email handlers).

-- A log source exists that indicates:
---- An incident was detected (event.type = incident_detected)
---- The method or status of reporting (reporting.automated = true|false)

-- The reporting logic is consistent enough that false negatives are rare (i.e., "automated" reporting is reliably tracked and logged when it occurs).

===

* Integration Options:
-- Wazuh custom JSON logs from:

---- SIEM automation
---- Syslog alerts from Helpdesk (like Jira, HaloPSA, or ServiceNow)
---- SOAR platform logs (TheHive, Cortex, etc.)

-- Correlation between alert rule → ticket/notification sent

===

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If there's no log or event indicating whether an alert was or was not reported automatically,
the rule won't trigger effectively — it may miss silent failures or cause false positives if heuristics aren’t robust.
