Notes:

CJIS 5.8.1 | NIST MP-2

This rule enforces logging, monitoring, and alerting for unauthorized access to all organization-defined types of media, including digital and physical formats.

Typical log sources:
- Windows Security Log: "Access denied" on removable media
- Linux audit logs: unauthorized mount/access attempts
- DLP systems: blocked file copies to USB/cloud
- Physical security logs: failed badge access to records rooms

Assumptions:
- Access lists are maintained in an auditable system.
- Security logging covers all relevant digital and physical assets.
- Event source normalization tags events as "media_access" for SIEM consumption.

Risks if non-compliant:
- Loss or exposure of CJIS-regulated data via unauthorized access, theft, or copying.
- Regulatory action, audit findings, or criminal liability for data leakage.
