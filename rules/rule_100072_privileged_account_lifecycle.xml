Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2.1 | NIST AC-2(7) – Privileged User Account Management

Purpose:
- Enforce structured provisioning, tracking, and deprovisioning of privileged user accounts.
- Ensure privileged access is tied to specific job duties and promptly removed when no longer needed.

Detection Examples:
- `useradd` or `usermod` commands used to create or promote accounts to sudo/wheel/root groups
- Windows Security Event ID 4728 (user added to a security-enabled global group)
- Auditd logs showing changes to `/etc/sudoers` or use of `gpasswd`
- AzureAD / EntraID role assignment activity logs

Assumptions:
- Log sources include detailed audit trails of account and permission changes
- Role-based access control policies are enforced via AD, SSO, IAM, or local mechanisms
- There is a defined and monitored group policy or IAM structure for elevated roles

Risk If Uncontrolled:
- Former employees or internal threats retaining privileged access
- Privilege creep due to poor offboarding or unclear responsibilities
- Undetected changes to group memberships enabling lateral escalation
