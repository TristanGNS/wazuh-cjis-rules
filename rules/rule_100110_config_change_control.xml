Notes:

CJIS 5.7.1 | NIST CM-3

This rule flags any unexpected or unapproved configuration change activity. It serves as an enforcement point for organizations implementing change management policies aligned with CJIS CM-3.

Assumptions:
- Systems emit logs (e.g., via auditd, sysmon, Wazuh SCA, or file integrity monitoring) identifying config file or system state changes
- Approval workflows are externally handled (e.g., ticketing systems, CMDB), and alerts represent deviations or unapproved events
- Change control governance (CMCB or equivalent) exists to enforce policy and review logs

Risks if unimplemented:
- Loss of traceability on system modifications
- Introduction of unverified software/config that could open attack vectors
- Audit failure due to lack of change records or approvals
