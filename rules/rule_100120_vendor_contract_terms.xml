Notes:

CJIS 5.7.2 | NIST SA-4

Supports compliance by detecting deficiencies in security/privacy language within vendor procurement processes, contracts, or acquisition documentation.

Examples of triggering events:
- Compliance reviews or audits flagging incomplete or missing security clauses in vendor contracts.
- Supply chain assessments lacking formal security acceptance criteria.
- Risk assessments noting vendor responsibility gaps.

Assumptions:
- Events are parsed from GRC platforms, procurement logs, or audit reports.
- Acquisition workflows are auditable and monitored (e.g., SIEM ingesting SharePoint logs, procurement DB logs).

Risks if non-compliant:
- Critical system components may lack enforceable security baselines.
- Exposure to supply chain-based breaches with no legal recourse.
