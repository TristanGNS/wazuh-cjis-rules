Notes:

CJIS 5.9.1 | NIST PE-2

**Intent of this Rule:**  
To enforce that only authorized individuals have access to CJIS facilities, through the development, approval, and ongoing maintenance of an up-to-date access list, and that credentials are issued, reviewed, and revoked as required.

**Requirements from Control:**  
a. Develop, approve, and maintain a current list of individuals with authorized access to each CJIS facility.
b. Issue facility access credentials only after authorization approval.
c. Review access lists at an **organization-defined frequency** (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to verify accuracy and relevance.
d. Promptly remove individuals from access lists and revoke credentials when access is no longer needed (e.g., job change, termination, role change).

**Log Source Assumptions:**
- Access control system logs tracking badge/credential issuance, revocation, and use.
- HR or identity management feeds for personnel changes affecting access rights.
- Access list change records, approval logs, and review activity logs.
- Audit logs of access list reviews, including dates, reviewers, and changes.
- Incident reports for unauthorized access or credentials not removed in a timely fashion.

**Integration Options:**
- Ingest badge issuance/revocation logs from access management systems.
- Correlate access list review activities and approval logs with personnel changes.
- Trigger alerts for overdue reviews, unapproved credential issuance, or failure to remove access.
- Automate monitoring for access list anomalies or mismatches with HR data.
- Link review and change events to incident response workflows if discrepancies are found.

**Assumptions:**
- Organization maintains a centralized, auditable access list for each secure facility.
- Badge and credential issuance/revocation is logged in real time.
- Regular, scheduled reviews are documented and performed.
- Policy defines timeframes for access removal and review intervals.

**Risks if Non-Compliant:**
- Access by individuals who should no longer have facility authorization (insider threat).
- Outdated or inaccurate access lists leading to security or audit findings.
- Credentials issued or not revoked without proper approval, risking facility security.
- Inability to track, audit, or respond to unauthorized facility access.

**[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]:**
- Organization must specify review intervals for access list verification. This rule assumes customization on deployment.

**<if_sid> Use:**
- Correlates with foundational physical access rule (100125/PE-3) to minimize false positives and ensure alerting only for true authorization/credential management events.
