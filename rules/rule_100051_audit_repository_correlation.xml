Notes:

CJIS 5.4.1 | NIST AU-6(3): Correlate Audit Record Repositories

* Assumptions:
-- The audit analysis engine (e.g., Wazuh, ELK stack, SIEM) includes enrichment metadata such as:
   - audit.repo_count (number of log sources contributing to correlation)
   - event.type = "audit_analysis"
-- Centralized analysis spans multiple sources (e.g., endpoint logs + firewall + VPN + cloud logs).

* Integration Options:
-- Wazuh agents forwarding to a central manager with logstash or Elasticsearch enrichment
-- SIEM rules or alerts that define correlation logic across logs
-- External correlation reports periodically imported and checked

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If only isolated logs are reviewed, the organization lacks visibility into attack paths and threat movement across environments, degrading CJIS-aligned situational awareness.
