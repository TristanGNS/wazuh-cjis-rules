Notes:

CJIS 5.5.6 | NIST AC-17(4) – Remote Access: Privileged Commands and Access

Purpose:
- To prevent untracked elevation of privileges through remote means.
- Ensure only authorized staff are allowed privileged access remotely and that their sessions are logged and reviewable.

Assumptions:
- Remote access tools (e.g., SSH, RDP, Guacamole, ZTNA) are integrated with auditing and session tracking.
- Privileged access (admin/root) is protected via PAM, group policy, or jump host controls.

Examples of Assessable Evidence:
- `script`-based shell session recording
- Teleport or BeyondTrust session audit logs
- Windows Event ID 4672 triggered via remote IP
- Bastion host logs that show user ID, command timestamp, and command string

SSP Inclusion (Required):
- Description of remote access method
- Access justification (e.g., emergency fix, after-hours support)
- Duration of elevation or role required
- Responsible personnel and approval process

Risks if Unmet:
- Privileged users could manipulate system settings or logs with no traceability.
- Incident response may be compromised without clear records.
- System integrity is undermined by unauthorized or excessive remote privilege use.
