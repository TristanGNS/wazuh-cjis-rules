Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2.1.1 | NIST IA-5(1)

This rule encompasses the comprehensive requirements of password-based authentication. The goal is to mitigate risks from poor password hygiene and reduce reliance on user discretion alone.

Detection logic focuses on:
- Authentication logs revealing weak or blocked passwords
- Indicators of hash usage (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2) for storage compliance
- Enforcement of password change policies on recovery
- Logging patterns indicating complexity enforcement or rejection messages

Assumptions:
- The organization supports secure hash functions (not plaintext or MD5)
- Login interfaces have logging capable of capturing these patterns
- Systems flag or reject weak/compromised credentials during password creation
