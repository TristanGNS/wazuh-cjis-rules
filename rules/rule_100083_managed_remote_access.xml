Notes:

CJIS 5.5.6 | NIST AC-17(3) – Remote Access | Managed Access Control Points

Purpose:
- Prevent unauthorized remote access paths or shadow connections.
- Ensure full visibility and auditing of remote sessions through chokepoints.

Assumptions:
- Centralized VPN, bastion, or ZTNA components are deployed.
- All inbound connections to CJIS systems require MFA and pass through firewall policies, proxies, or access brokers.

Examples:
- Cisco ASA VPN Gateway logs user authentication and assigns ACL based on group policy.
- Guacamole or JumpCloud relays remote desktop sessions through hardened gateways.
- ZTNA brokers restrict traffic based on user, device, and risk posture.

Risks if Unchecked:
- Remote users may establish unsanctioned direct access to sensitive systems, bypassing security enforcement.
- Monitoring systems will lack full visibility if access control points are not centralized.
- Compromise of a single endpoint could result in unrestricted lateral movement.
