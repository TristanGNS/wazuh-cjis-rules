Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2 | NIST IA-2(8)

This rule enforces the requirement that all authentication methods for privileged and non-privileged accounts must include replay-resistant protections.

Replay resistance ensures that even if an attacker captures a credential or session artifact, it cannot be reused to gain unauthorized access.

Examples of compliant mechanisms include:
- Public-key-based mutual authentication (e.g., TLS with client certs)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions that generate ephemeral codes
- Cryptographic challenge-response systems
- Kerberos with short-lived ticket granting
- FIDO2 / WebAuthn with client-side attestation

Monitored event types should include:
- Logins using non-encrypted channels (e.g., telnet, FTP)
- Use of legacy protocols (NTLM, LDAP simple bind)
- Detected credential reuse or replay signatures

This rule may require advanced logging and heuristic detection via SIEM integration or endpoint security tooling.
