Notes:

CJIS 5.7.2 | NIST CM-5(1)

Supports compliance through:
- Automated blocking of unauthorized change attempts via policy-based mechanisms.
- Generating real-time audit logs from mechanisms such as:
  - SELinux/AppArmor violations
  - auditd syscall blocks
  - Windows security logs (Event IDs 4656, 4657, 4663)
  - RBAC enforcement

Assumptions:
- Host-based access controls are centrally managed or deployed (e.g., Ansible, GPO, Puppet).
- Logging pipelines capture and forward access violations.
- Access controls are defined in accordance with organizational policy (role-based or least privilege).

Risks if non-compliant:
- Manual enforcement fails silently or inconsistently.
- Lack of verifiable logs makes accountability and root cause analysis impossible after a breach.
