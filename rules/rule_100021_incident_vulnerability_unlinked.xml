Notes:

CJIS 5.3.1 | NIST IR-6(2): Vulnerabilities Related to Incidents

* Assumptions:
-- You are tracking vulnerabilities using tools such as:

---- Wazuhâ€™s vulnerability-detector module
---- External scanners like OpenVAS, Nessus, Qualys

-- There is an incident correlation mechanism or tagging standard such that:
---- Incidents include or reference known CVEs
---- vuln.linked = true|false (or similar flag) is present in IR logs

* Integration Options:
-- Wazuh with vulnerability integration + incident tagging
-- Custom decoder/enrichment logic that links incident tickets to CVE databases or vulnerability scan logs

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If incident logs and vulnerability data are siloed (i.e., not linked in logs), this rule cannot operate correctly. 
It may need manual correlation or data engineering support to work well in non-integrated environments.
