Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2.1 | NIST AC-6(5) – Privileged Account Restriction

Purpose:
- Detects unauthorized or unreviewed assignment of privileged roles to user accounts.
- Reinforces least privilege by ensuring only organization-defined personnel/roles can maintain privileged access.

Detection Examples:
- Unauthorized use of `usermod -aG sudo`
- Alerts on new group membership to `Administrators`, `root`, or `wheel`
- SIEM events from Active Directory showing unapproved elevation
- PAM or auditd entries showing privilege modification

Assumptions:
- Central directory services (e.g., AD, LDAP) or local system groups control elevated permissions
- Group memberships are auditable and alerts are triggered on modification
- Role definitions and privilege eligibility lists are documented and enforced by policy

Risks if Uncontrolled:
- Unauthorized users gain root/system-level access
- Insider threat or lateral escalation attacks go undetected
- Accountability breaks down due to excessive privilege distribution
