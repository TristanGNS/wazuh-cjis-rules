Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2.1 | NIST AC-10 – Concurrent Session Control

Purpose:
- Detects conditions where a user or process exceeds the defined concurrent session limit.
- Helps enforce least privilege and reduce account misuse by limiting active sessions.

Detection Examples:
- SSH logs reporting "Too many concurrent connections"
- RDP logs showing duplicate logon attempts
- VPN appliance events that deny access based on existing session count
- SIEM alerts triggered by brute-force login behavior or session hijack attempts

Assumptions:
- Session enforcement policies are defined and enforced at PAM, firewall, VPN, or application level
- Audit logs from session brokers, VPNs, remote access systems are collected centrally
- Mapping of user account types (privileged vs. standard) is maintained and integrated with session policies

Risk If Uncontrolled:
- Increases risk of unauthorized access persistence
- Obfuscates audit trails by allowing too many simultaneous identities
- Enables session replay or takeover without user detection
