Notes:

CJIS 5.7.1.1 | NIST CM-8(3)

This rule enforces automated detection of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components.

Assumptions:
- Asset inventories are continuously maintained via agents or scanning tools
- Detected anomalies generate logs that include asset ID, device name, timestamp, and violation type
- The organization has a policy for periodic baseline enforcement and alert triage

Recommendations:
- Integrate with EDR, NAC, or configuration compliance systems to respond in real time
- Trigger endpoint isolation or alert escalation workflows when unknown components are discovered

Risks if not implemented:
- Undetected rogue or shadow IT devices
- Unauthorized firmware modifications
- Inability to meet audit or compliance expectations for asset integrity
