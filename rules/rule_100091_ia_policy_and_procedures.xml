Notes:

CJIS 5.6.1 | NIST IA-1

This rule verifies that the organization has developed and disseminated an identification and authentication policy framework. It requires:
- A documented policy that includes scope, roles, responsibilities, compliance references, and applicability
- Designation of a responsible IA official
- Regular review and update cycles (event-driven or scheduled)
- Accompanying implementation procedures

If these are not formally in place, documented, reviewed, and owned by an appointed party, the control is not met.

Recommended:
- Publish a policy document with named IA officer
- Define review frequency (e.g., annually)
- Include regulatory references such as CJIS, NIST 800-53, etc.
