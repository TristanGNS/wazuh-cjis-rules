Notes:

CJIS 5.4.3 | NIST AU-6(1): Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting | Automated Process Integration

* Requirements:
-- Organizations must leverage automated tools to integrate the audit review, analysis, and reporting lifecycle.
-- Manual review alone is insufficient. Logs should feed into automated systems for correlation, anomaly detection, and alerting.
-- Examples of compliant mechanisms include:
   - Wazuh rulesets with agent log correlation
   - SIEM pipelines (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk)
   - Scheduled log queries or dashboards

* Assumptions:
-- Log records are ingested into Wazuh or an external analysis engine.
-- Field `audit.analysis.automated` is set via enrichment, decoder, or log annotation to indicate automation coverage.

* Integration Suggestions:
-- Validate log ingestion is complete and timely.
-- Define scheduled queries or saved searches (e.g., in Kibana or Splunk) that run automatically.
-- Ensure output from analysis flows into notification systems or reports.

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
-- Without automation, logs may go unreviewed.
-- Manual audit processes are error-prone, untimely, and ineffective at detecting patterns or correlated threats.
