Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2.1 | NIST AC-5 – Separation of Duties

Purpose:
- Detects activity that may indicate a user is violating separation of duties principles by performing actions reserved for different roles.

Assumptions:
- Organization defines key role conflicts (e.g., 'no single user can approve their own access').
- Log source includes user role assignments and correlated actions (e.g., LDAP role assignment + audit logs + sudo activity).
- Role overlap or cross-role behavior is detectable via log correlation or role-based tagging.

Detection Examples:
- Same user performs a privileged action (e.g., user provisioning) and later audits the same activity.
- A user switches between roles in a short time window that violates duty segregation (e.g., from finance approver to payment initiator).
- Direct log messages indicating policy override or conflict-of-interest activity.

Risks if Uncontrolled:
- Fraud, data integrity compromise, and audit failure.
- Inability to enforce CJIS and NIST access control policy.
- Hidden misuse of administrative or privileged roles.
