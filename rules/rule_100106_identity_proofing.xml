Notes:

CJIS 5.6.3 | NIST IA-12

This rule supports enforcement of identity proofing prior to account creation, uniquely resolving users, and maintaining auditable evidence of verification.

Assumptions:
- New user onboarding requires HR or supervisor-submitted identity validation
- Shared or generic logins are flagged as noncompliant
- Audit logs can correlate account creation with identity evidence
- Identity documents are stored per organizational retention policy

Risks if unimplemented:
- Non-repudiation failure
- Audit trail gaps
- Insider threat using false credentials
