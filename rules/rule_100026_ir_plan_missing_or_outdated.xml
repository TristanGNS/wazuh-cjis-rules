Notes:

CJIS 5.3.2 | NIST IR-8: Incident Response Plan

* Assumptions:
-- Your organization maintains an incident response plan and tracks its lifecycle via logs or audit metadata
-- Logs contain fields such as `event.type=ir_plan_status`, and `plan.status` (e.g., outdated, missing, draft, distributed)
-- Reviews and distributions are triggered by time, structural changes, or incidents

* Integration Options:
-- Compliance/audit logging system exporting document status
-- Scheduled task output from a GRC platform (e.g., LogicGate, ZenGRC)
-- File integrity monitoring (e.g., Wazuh FIM) on IR policy documents with a metadata layer for review tracking

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If the incident response plan status is not explicitly logged or reviewed on a schedule, this rule cannot provide value. Recommend implementing document tracking or IR policy versioning to support visibility.
