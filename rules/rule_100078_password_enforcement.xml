Notes:

CJIS 5.5.3 | NIST IA-5(1) – Password-based Authentication

Purpose:
- Detects failures or misconfigurations related to password complexity, secure transmission, or strength validation.
- Ensures authentication hygiene is enforced through policy and automation.

Assumptions:
- The system logs password change failures, password rejection reasons, and authentication channel security (e.g., via LDAP logs, PAM stack, or SIEM).
- The denylist (commonly-used/compromised passwords) is integrated into the password management system.
- Secure password storage uses salted and hashed functions.
- Admins configure recovery flows to require forced reset.

Detection Examples:
- A user attempts a password found in `rockyou.txt` or Pwned Passwords database.
- Passwords are transmitted over HTTP or LDAP without TLS.
- Admin logs reveal password hash storage in MD5 or unsalted SHA1.
- Login attempts flagged for "insecure transmission" or "weak password" errors.

Risk if Uncontrolled:
- Increased vulnerability to brute force, credential stuffing, or replay attacks.
- Account compromise due to known password leaks or poor user selection.
- Non-compliance with CJIS and NIST authentication policies.
