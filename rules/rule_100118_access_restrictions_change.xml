Notes:

CJIS 5.7.2 | NIST CM-5

This rule supports the enforcement of change access controls. It should detect:
- Changes to configuration files by users lacking elevated access.
- Attempted physical or remote changes without a corresponding approval log.
- Access attempts outside of change windows or without proper MFA.

Assumptions:
- Logs from PAM, auditd, sudo, Windows Security (Event ID 4670, 4688), or change control platforms are being ingested.
- Privileged sessions are monitored, and config paths are tracked.
- SIEM correlation links change events to approval workflows.

Risks if not enforced:
- Unauthorized changes may introduce backdoors or misconfigurations.
- Regulatory and audit violations for failing to protect critical system integrity.
- Insider threats or lateral movement from compromised accounts.
