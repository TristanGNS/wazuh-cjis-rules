Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2 | NIST AC-3: Access Enforcement

* Purpose:
  - Ensures access controls are actively enforced based on authorizations
  - Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive systems, apps, or files
  - Complements AC-2 (account mgmt), PS-4 (termination), and AC-6 (least privilege)

* Implementation should include:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) or Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
  - Group policy and firewall enforcement for network access
  - Access denied logs from identity providers (e.g., Okta, AD, Duo, Azure)
  - System logs for failed ACL checks, permission issues, and policy blocks

* Monitoring Use Cases:
  - Denied logon due to group policy
  - Rejected API calls due to lack of scope
  - File access violations from endpoint logs
  - Attempted privilege escalation flagged by enforcement engine

* Assumptions:
  - Logging is enabled on authentication gateways and endpoints
  - Centralized logging solution (e.g., Wazuh + syslog/SIEM) ingests access violation events

* Risks if Unmet:
  - Unauthorized lateral movement
  - Data exfiltration due to over-permissioned users
  - Insider threats with unrestricted access
