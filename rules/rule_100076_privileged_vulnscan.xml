Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2.1 | NIST RA-5(5) – Privileged Access for Vulnerability Scanning

Purpose:
- Ensures that only authorized scan processes/users can perform privileged-level vulnerability scans on sensitive system components.

Detection Examples:
- Nessus or OpenVAS scans using admin/root credentials
- Authenticated scans targeting domain controllers, firewalls, or database servers
- Scan tools configured with SSH keys, privileged tokens, or AD accounts

Assumptions:
- Vulnerability scanning tools require elevated access to perform authenticated scans.
- Organization defines which systems can be scanned and who can perform them.
- Audit trails/logs capture when/where/how scanners are authenticated.

Risks if Uncontrolled:
- Scanner tools could be exploited to gain access beyond intended scope
- Weak credential handling could expose admin-level accounts
- Excessive privilege in scanning processes violates least privilege principle
