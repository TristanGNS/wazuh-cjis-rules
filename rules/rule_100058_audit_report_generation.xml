Notes:

CJIS 5.4.3 | NIST AU-7: Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation

* Requirements:
-- Systems must allow users (e.g., admins, auditors) to generate audit reports on demand without waiting for scheduled intervals.
-- These reports should aid in security investigations and incident response.
-- Log reduction (aggregation, filtering) is allowed as long as:
   - It does not remove relevant fields
   - It does not change the time sequence of events

* Assumptions:
-- The system logs contain structured fields such as timestamp, source, and event type.
-- Log reports are generated from reduced views but raw audit data is still preserved and accessible.
-- The field `audit.integrity.preserved = false` flags cases where reporting tools modify time ordering or redact data.

* Integration Suggestions:
-- Leverage tools like Kibana, Grafana, Splunk, or Wazuh dashboards to generate on-demand reports.
-- Ensure audit reduction scripts (e.g., daily summaries) retain raw log references or links.
-- Validate integrity via checksums, immutable storage, or versioned logs.

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
-- If logs are altered or aggregated in a way that obscures original data, legal defensibility and forensic traceability is lost.
-- Without on-demand reporting, incident detection and response may be delayed or impossible.
