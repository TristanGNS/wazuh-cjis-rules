Notes:

CJIS 5.5.6 | NIST AC-17 – Remote Access

Purpose:
- Controls the conditions under which users may remotely access protected systems.
- Ensures access methods are explicitly documented, configured securely, and pre-approved.

Assumptions:
- All remote access is logged and monitored.
- Logs include the connection method, user ID, source IP, and session time.
- VPN or remote session management systems are integrated with SIEM or Wazuh for auditing.

Examples:
- RDP login to Windows Server from an external IP.
- VPN authentication log entries from OpenVPN, Fortinet, or WireGuard.
- SSH connection attempts via jump servers or bastions.
- Access Control system audit logs showing successful remote authorization.

Risks if Unchecked:
- Backdoors may be introduced via unauthorized remote methods (e.g., TeamViewer, Shadow IT).
- Insecure or unmonitored remote access increases risk of lateral movement, data exfiltration, and credential theft.
- Lack of policy enforcement can result in violations of CJIS and internal cybersecurity policies.
