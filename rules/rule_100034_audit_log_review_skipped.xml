Notes:

CJIS 5.3.2.2 | NIST AU-6: Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting

* Assumptions:
-- Audit review processes emit logs indicating the status of audit reviews (e.g., `event.type=audit_review`, `review.status=on_time|overdue|skipped`)
-- Risk-based alerting is in place, and failure to elevate review frequency (based on threat intel or law enforcement info) is auditable

* Integration Options:
-- SIEM audit log review summary logs
-- SOAR platform or GRC system that monitors audit review cadence and threat escalation triggers
-- Manual log review system with schedule tracking (cron, SCA checks)

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If audit review activity is not tracked or surfaced in logs, this rule cannot evaluate control effectiveness. Recommend emitting audit cadence logs and including status flags in review workflows.
