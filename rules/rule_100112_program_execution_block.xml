Notes:

CJIS 5.7.1.1 | NIST CM-7(2)

This rule enforces least functionality by detecting or blocking program execution that is not in alignment with approved software lists or organizational usage agreements.

Assumptions:
- Endpoint protection software or OS policies are configured to generate logs when execution is denied
- Execution blocking is centrally managed and logs are forwarded to Wazuh or other SIEM tools
- Unauthorized programs are identified by path, hash, signature, or execution behavior

Recommendations:
- Maintain a tight software approval process with periodic reviews
- Automate response via SOAR or EDR when unauthorized execution is attempted
- Review denial logs for insider threat indicators or misconfigurations

Risks if not implemented:
- Unauthorized tools (e.g., password crackers, port scanners) may be executed
- Increased likelihood of malware running on endpoints
- Policy violations without auditability or enforcement
