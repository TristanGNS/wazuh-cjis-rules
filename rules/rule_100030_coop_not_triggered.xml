Notes:

CJIS 5.3.2.1 | NIST IR-4(3): Continuity of Operations

* Assumptions:
-- Incidents are classified by severity or type (e.g., `incident.class=critical`, `incident.class=high`)
-- Your system tracks whether business continuity (COOP) actions were executed (`coop.triggered=true|false`)
-- This data is logged in structured incident tracking, SOAR, or response metadata

* Integration Options:
-- SOAR or IR ticketing platforms with tagged fields for incident class and COOP status
-- Custom playbooks that log COOP invocation steps (e.g., alt VPN/firewall config push, comms redirect)

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If incident classification and continuity response are not logged or tracked, this rule cannot validate COOP execution. Recommend policy enforcement and logging for continuity procedures during incident handling.
