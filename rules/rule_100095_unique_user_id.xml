Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2 | NIST IA-2

This rule enforces the requirement that every user be individually identified and authenticated prior to system access.

Organizations must:
- Assign and manage individual credentials
- Prohibit the use of shared or generic accounts unless paired with MFA and audit logging
- Ensure that all system processes and logged events are traceable to a unique user
- Enforce credential rotation, lifecycle management, and periodic access reviews

Detection should trigger on:
- Authentication attempts using anonymous, guest, or default usernames
- Access attempts without a resolved UID
- System logs lacking a user attribution field

This rule supports identity-centric auditing and accountability controls required for compliance and forensic integrity.
