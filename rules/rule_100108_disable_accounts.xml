<!--
Notes:

CJIS 5.6.3.1 | NIST AC-2(3)

Supports account disablement within an organization-defined timeframe under any of the following conditions:
(a) Account expiration
(b) User separation or reassignment
(c) Policy violations
(d) Extended inactivity

Assumptions:
- Directory services (AD, LDAP) or IdPs are logging disablement events
- Inactivity and expiration thresholds are configured in accordance with org policy
- Alerts are generated either from system logs or SIEM parsing (e.g., event ID 4726 in Windows)

Risks if unimplemented:
- Orphaned accounts present credential compromise risk
- Accounts may retain access despite changes in employment or roles
- Lack of enforcement undermines access control model
