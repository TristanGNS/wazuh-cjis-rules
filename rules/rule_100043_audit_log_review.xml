Notes:

CJIS 5.4.1 | NIST AU-6: Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting

* Assumptions:
-- You have an audit log parser/enricher (e.g., Wazuh ruleset or custom script) that flags entries as suspicious or anomalous via fields like:
   - audit.anomaly_detected = true
   - audit.reviewed = false
   - alert.sent = false (if alerting never happened)

-- Thereâ€™s a scheduled process for audit log review and alerting (manual or automated).

* Integration Options:
-- Integration with SIEMs or Wazuh's `ossec`/`wodle_audit` modules, applying anomaly detection flags.
-- Rule can operate on enhanced logs produced by a post-processing step (e.g., parsed Sysmon or auditd output enriched with anomaly indicators).

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
If audit logs are not reviewed or labeled post-ingestion, or anomalies are not programmatically tagged, this rule may not function. Manual tagging or ML-assisted classification is a viable workaround.
