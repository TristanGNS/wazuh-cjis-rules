Notes:

CJIS 5.8.1 | NIST MP-5

This rule enforces documentation, accountability, and control for any transport of system media (digital or non-digital) outside secure/controlled areas.

Typical log sources:
- Media checkout/return logs (digital or paper, must be auditable)
- Shipping or courier records with chain-of-custody tracking
- SIEM or DLP logs flagging unencrypted removable device ejection/connection events
- Incident tracking: lost/missing media, or unauthorized personnel involvement

Assumptions:
- All transport requests and approvals are logged, and logs are regularly reviewed.
- Media is physically secured (locked, sealed) and/or logically protected (encryption).
- Organization maintains a list of personnel authorized to handle and transport media.
- All deviations or policy violations (missing log, lost media, improper handling) are treated as incidents.

Risks if non-compliant:
- Loss, theft, or tampering with CJIS-controlled data during transport.
- Audit findings or legal exposure due to incomplete chain of custody or unauthorized handlers.
