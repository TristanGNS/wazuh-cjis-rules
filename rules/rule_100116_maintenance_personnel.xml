Notes:

CJIS 5.7.2 | NIST MA-5

This rule detects when system maintenance is conducted by individuals lacking proper authorization, or when supervision protocols are not followed.

Assumptions:
- Wazuh receives logs from ticketing systems, badge/access logs, or CMDB systems that correlate technician identity and activity.
- Escorted vs. unescorted status can be inferred based on user groups, timestamps, or logs from physical security systems.
- CM or SIEM tools may generate alerts if non-authorized users access maintenance tools or admin shells.

Risks if not implemented:
- Increased insider threat or accidental misconfiguration risk.
- Lack of chain-of-custody during critical maintenance operations.
- Reduced forensic traceability in case of post-maintenance incidents.
