Notes:

CJIS 5.5.6.1 | NIST AC-20 – Use of External Systems

This control governs access to CJIS systems and data from personally owned or externally managed devices.

Compliant implementations may:
- Prohibit external access altogether
- Permit access with controls such as MDM, AV, encryption, audit logging

Organizations must document:
- Terms and conditions for access
- Device controls
- Authorized personnel and systems

Enforcement mechanisms:
- Conditional access policy (M365)
- VPN + MFA
- VDI with restricted clipboard/file transfer
- SIEM alerts for unmanaged device logins
