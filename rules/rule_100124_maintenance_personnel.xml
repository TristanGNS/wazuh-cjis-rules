Notes:

CJIS 5.9.1 | NIST MA-5

This rule enforces strict control and oversight of all maintenance activities on CJIS systems by:
- Requiring a formal process for authorizing and maintaining a list of permitted maintenance organizations/personnel.
- Ensuring that anyone performing non-escorted maintenance has their access authorizations checked and logged prior to work beginning.
- Mandating that any maintenance performed by individuals without required authorizations is supervised in real time by appropriately cleared and technically competent staff.
- Documenting all maintenance access events, including approvals, supervisory actions, and access verification steps.

Log sources may include:
- Access control logs (e.g., badge, sign-in/out)
- Maintenance scheduling/ticketing systems
- Physical security incident reports
- SIEM events referencing maintenance or staff approval actions

Assumptions:
- Maintenance lists are current and reviewed regularly.
- All maintenance access events are logged and can be correlated to a specific individual.
- Non-escorted maintenance is only performed by individuals on the approved list.
- Supervisors are present and documented for any supervised maintenance activities.

Risks if non-compliant:
- Unauthorized individuals may access sensitive CJIS systems or data.
- Regulatory or audit failures due to lack of documented access or supervision.
- Increased risk of compromise, tampering, or data loss.
