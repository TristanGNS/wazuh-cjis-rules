Notes:

CJIS 5.5.6 | NIST AC-17(1) – Automated Monitoring and Control for Remote Access

Purpose:
- To ensure remote access is not just permitted and logged, but also actively monitored and enforceable in real-time.

Monitoring Mechanisms May Include:
- SIEM rules for remote access events (e.g., Wazuh, ELK, Splunk)
- Alerts for geographic anomalies or impossible travel
- Session capture tools (teleport audit log, RDP gateway logs)

Control Mechanisms May Include:
- Auto-kill idle sessions after 15 minutes
- Block connections from unregistered IPs or devices
- Deny access based on failed posture checks

Evidence:
- Log entries showing session start/stop
- SIEM alert activity
- EDR agent denying unauthorized tool usage

Risks if Unmet:
- Remote sessions could be left unattended or misused
- No centralized detection of malicious activity over remote channels
- No accountability trail or enforceable session boundaries
