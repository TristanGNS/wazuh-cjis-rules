Notes:

CJIS 5.7.2 | NIST CM-8

This rule is triggered when an inventory management tool (e.g., Wazuh SCA, Lansweeper, or other CMDB) detects a discrepancy or absence of a system component in the documented inventory.

Assumptions:
- The organization uses an automated or semi-automated asset inventory solution with scheduled reconciliation
- Logs are centralized and parsed for anomalies (e.g., components showing up in network traffic or logs but missing from inventory)
- The control requires metadata completeness and accuracy, not just device presence

Risks if not implemented:
- Incomplete asset visibility increases risk of shadow IT or unmanaged vulnerabilities
- Forensic efforts may be hindered by unaccounted assets
- Fails fundamental compliance principles for system accountability
