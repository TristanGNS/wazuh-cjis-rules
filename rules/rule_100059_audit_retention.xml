Notes:

CJIS 5.4.3 | NIST AU-11: Audit Record Retention

* Requirements:
-- Audit logs must be retained for an organization-defined period that aligns with:
   - Internal retention policies
   - Legal or regulatory requirements (e.g., 1 year minimum for many agencies)
   - Incident investigation and forensic readiness needs

* Assumptions:
-- Logs are stored with metadata such as creation date and expiration/purge date
-- The system has a field (or queryable metric) representing `audit.retention.days`
-- Default compliance threshold in this rule is < 90 days (adjustable per agency policy)

* Integration Recommendations:
-- Use Wazuh's `wazuh-modulesd` log collector with `global.db` queries or external storage alerts
-- Consider immutable log storage options (e.g., S3 with WORM, or SIEM log archiving) for CJIS-compliant retention

* Risk Without Assumption Met:
-- Without clear visibility into audit log lifecycles, retention violations may go unnoticed
-- Inadequate retention impairs post-incident forensics, undermines legal defensibility, and breaks CJIS compliance

* Tuning Suggestions:
-- Customize `audit.retention.days` threshold based on agency-specific policies (e.g., 180, 365, 730 days)
-- Include additional checks for log archive availability (e.g., backup confirmations)
