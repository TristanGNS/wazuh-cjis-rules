Notes:

CJIS 5.6.3.2 | NIST IA-5(6)

Requires organizations to protect all authenticators in accordance with the security category of the systems they access.

Examples of authenticators:
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Certificates and private keys
- Smart cards
- Biometric data

Assumptions:
- Credential stores (e.g., LDAP, AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub, system keyrings) are monitored or log violations
- Alerts generated from Wazuh decoders, log parsing, or DLP tools

Risks if unimplemented:
- Exposure of credentials used to access high-impact systems
- Attackers gaining privilege escalation via leaked or reused secrets
- Breaches of data protected by strong authentication undermined by weak key handling
