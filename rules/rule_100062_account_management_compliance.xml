Notes:

CJIS 5.5.1 | NIST AC-2: Account Management

* Required Capabilities:
  - Maintain documented account types (e.g., individual, admin, shared, service)
  - Assign responsible account managers with clear oversight roles
  - Apply organizationally-defined prerequisites for group/role membership
  - Ensure account creation/removal follows policy and receives proper approval
  - Track account status changes (disable, transfer, termination, inactivity)
  - Review account compliance on an organization-defined periodic basis
  - Validate access based on current role, authorization, and need-to-know
  - Notify managers within a specific timeframe when:
    - A user is terminated or transferred
    - An account becomes unnecessary
    - A user's system access needs change

* Assumptions:
  - All identity lifecycle events (creation, disablement, deletion, etc.) are logged
    in Active Directory, LDAP, Linux usermod/passwd commands, or HR automation tools
  - Access reviews and attestation may be logged in ticketing or IAM systems
  - Group membership and policy violations are detectable via Wazuh file monitoring,
    audit logs, or scheduled compliance checks
  - Shared account credentials (if allowed) are rotated on offboarding

* Implementation Guidance:
  - Enable event log collection from AD: 
    â€¢ Event IDs: 4720 (create), 4722 (enable), 4725 (disable), 4726 (delete), 4732/34 (group change)
  - Monitor `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, and `chage` on Linux
  - Periodic access reviews should be reported and logged (e.g., quarterly)
  - Track offboarding steps (e.g., tickets, HR system triggers) using Wazuh correlation or 3rd-party integration

* Risks if Unmonitored:
  - Orphaned accounts and privilege creep
  - Misuse of system access due to stale roles
  - Violation of principle of least privilege and CJIS IAM policies
