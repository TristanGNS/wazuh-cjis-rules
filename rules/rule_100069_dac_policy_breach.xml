Notes:

CJIS 5.5.2 | NIST AC-3(4) – Discretionary Access Control

* Purpose:
  - Prevents users or programs with discretionary access from inadvertently or maliciously expanding access to protected objects.
  - Ensures subject-object permissions are enforced consistently even in decentralized or user-managed permission schemes.

* Key Detection Focus:
  - Audit logs where users or programs change security descriptors (NTFS ACLs, Linux chmod/chown)
  - Attempts to override group policies or elevate access via DAC rules
  - Privilege inheritance manipulations (e.g., recursive permissions in shared folders or cloud buckets)
  - Users assigning access to others without required oversight or approval

* Implementation Considerations:
  - Windows: Monitor Event ID 4670 (permissions on an object were changed), 4662 (object operation), and NTFS file permission logs.
  - Linux: Auditd rules for `chown`, `chmod`, or `setfacl`.
  - Cloud: IAM or bucket policy changes (e.g., AWS CloudTrail logs showing `PutBucketAcl`, `PutObjectAcl`)

* Example Violations:
  - A user grants another user access to a file or folder without required review
  - A process sets world-readable permissions on a sensitive object
  - A modified application binary receives access to new roles via inherited attributes

* Risk if Unaddressed:
  - Unauthorized access propagation
  - Privilege escalation by insiders
  - Leakage of sensitive or CJIS-regulated data

* Assumptions:
  - The system uses DAC (versus MAC or RBAC) for user-level access control
  - File and object audit events are forwarded to SIEM/Wazuh
