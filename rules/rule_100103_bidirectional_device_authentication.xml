Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2.2 | NIST IA-3(1)

This rule supports cryptographically-based, bidirectional device authentication to establish trust between organization-defined devices and their destinations.

Log source assumptions:
- Authentication logs from mutual TLS sessions, VPN concentrators, and certificate services
- Event logs showing client/server certificate issues or key negotiation failures
- SSH daemon logs with mutual identity validation

Risks if unimplemented:
- Devices could connect without validating the authenticity of the server, or vice versa
- Man-in-the-middle attacks, rogue device access, or untrusted connection establishment
