Notes:

CJIS 5.6.2 | NIST IA-3

This rule enforces the CJIS requirement to uniquely identify and authenticate organizationally defined devices before allowing system access.

Typical implementation methods:
- Certificate-based mutual TLS authentication
- MAC address + certificate pair validation
- Endpoint management with device posture validation (e.g., via MDM, NAC)
- Use of endpoint UUIDs + TPM-bound identity assertions

Devices that bypass authentication represent a critical security risk and violate compliance. Alerts should be generated when:
- A device connects without authentication
- A device's certificate is invalid, revoked, or mismatched
- A connection is attempted from an unrecognized or unmanaged device

This rule supports enforcement through log inspection of authentication events and connection attempts.
